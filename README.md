## Data sources; please download
1. https://www.kaggle.com/kiva/data-science-for-good-kiva-crowdfunding 
  We mainly require the kiva_loans.csv and kiva_mpi_region_locations.csv files.
  The reason for this is that the datasets are too large to be uploaded to this 
  repository and alternatively can be downloaded as ZIP file from the original Kaggle competition.
2. https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.POP.TOTL
  Although this is available from this repository.
## Quick-Start Guide:
* The format of the project is as a Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb).
* It is recommended that it is run on Google Colab with the three datasets (listed above) be uploaded on their.
* There are a couple of modules that I have used that you might have to install, notably;
  1. numpys,
  2. pandas*,
  3. matplotlib
  4. collections
  5. Basemap*
  6. typing
  7. random
  8. sckitlearn*
  9. math
  
Those that are starred I believe does not come by default on Ananconda.
* And that is pretty much it, everything is self-contained within the notebook, so should be simple to run, including the details of my project so 
please have a read through.
* If there is anything that is confusing you or does not work, please feel free to email me in the email address inside the .ipynb file.
